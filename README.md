## Installation
It will be necessary to set up a database through MySQL or DataGrip, as well as to create a .env file in the repo. After entering 'npm install' on the command line, all the dependencies should be pre-installed. From there, accessing the localhost server will allow you to both connect to internal & external APIs.
## Usage
Download the repo locally, set up a Postgres database, create an .env file with relevant usernames and passwords as well as JWT Secret Keys. The front end can be initiated through 'npm run dev' and the back end can be initiated through 'npm run server.'

## Features
This app is the starting point for a larger app that could be developed - some features we could include are creating recipes from scratch, adding or following users & interacting with them in various ways, keeping track of number of times a recipe has been cooked, and editing recipes that you've included.
## Contributing
Download the GitHub repo and edit it locally! Be sure to give us credit :)
## Tests
This app is still in its development stages - some functionality has been achieved, but there is more testing to be done in order to get it fully streamlined.
